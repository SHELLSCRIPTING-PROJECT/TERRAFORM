# Providers 

A provider in Terraform is a plugin that enables interaction with an API. 
This includes cloud providers, SaaS providers, and other APIs. The providers are specified in the Terraform configuration code. They tell Terraform which services it needs to interact with.

For example, if you want to use Terraform to create a virtual machine on AWS, you would need to use the aws provider. The aws provider provides a set of resources that Terraform can use to create, manage, and destroy virtual machines on AWS.

Here is an example of how to use the aws provider in a Terraform configuration:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0" # Change the AMI 
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

In this example, we are first defining the aws provider. We are specifying the region as us-east-1. Then, we are defining the `aws_instance` resource. We are specifying the `AMI ID` and the `instance type`.

When Terraform runs, it will first install the aws provider. Then, it will use the aws provider to create the virtual machine.

Here are some other examples of providers:

- `azurerm` - for Azure
- `google` - for Google Cloud Platform
- `kubernetes` - for Kubernetes
- `openstack` - for OpenStack
- `vsphere` - for VMware vSphere

There are many other providers available, and new ones are being added all the time.

Providers are an essential part of Terraform. They allow Terraform to interact with a wide variety of cloud providers and other APIs. This makes Terraform a very versatile tool that can be used to manage a wide variety of infrastructure.


## Different ways to configure providers in terraform

There are three main ways to configure providers in Terraform:

### In the root module 

This is the most common way to configure providers. The provider configuration block is placed in the root module of the Terraform configuration. This makes the provider configuration available to all the resources in the configuration.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### In a child module

You can also configure providers in a child module. This is useful if you want to reuse the same provider configuration in multiple resources.

```hcl
module "aws_vpc" {
  source = "./aws_vpc"
  providers = {
    aws = aws.us-west-2
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  depends_on = [module.aws_vpc]
}
```
# module "aws_vpc":

This module is used to define a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). It references a local path ./aws_vpc, meaning you likely have a folder named aws_vpc in the same directory as this script.
The module is set to use the AWS provider in the us-west-2 region.
 
# resource "aws_instance" "example":

This resource block creates an EC2 instance.
It specifies the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) ID with "ami-0123456789abcdef0", which youâ€™ll need to update to a valid ID for your use case.
The instance type is set to "t2.micro", which is a free-tier eligible instance type.
The depends_on parameter specifies that this instance relies on the aws_vpc module to be created first, ensuring that the VPC is set up before launching the instance.
This setup helps structure the infrastructure code by separating the VPC configuration into its own module, making it reusable and modular.




### In the required_providers block

You can also configure providers in the required_providers block. This is useful if you want to make sure that a specific provider version is used.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.79"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
In this updated Terraform configuration:

 # required_providers block 
 
    specifies that the aws provider should be sourced from hashicorp/aws with a version constraint of ~> 3.79, meaning it will use version 3.79 or any compatible updates.

# aws_instance "example"
   
   resource defines an EC2 instance with an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of "ami-0123456789abcdef0" and an instance type of "t2.micro".

This configuration is minimal and does not include advanced dependencies or module structures. It's suitable for quickly launching a basic EC2 instance within AWS, as long as the AWS provider and required version are available in the environment.


The best way to configure providers depends on your specific needs. If you are only using a single provider, then configuring it in the root module is the simplest option. If you are using multiple providers, or if you want to reuse the same provider configuration in multiple resources, then configuring it in a child module is a good option. And if you want to make sure that a specific provider version is used, then configuring it in the required_providers block is the best option.
